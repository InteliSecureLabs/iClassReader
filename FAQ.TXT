FAQ
=====

1. It does not work?
   It does work I guarantee, I just stripped out HID's proprietary MASTER KEYS.

   If you get the error popup "Can not retrieve list of readers", its because you need the OmniKey 5xxx
   Reader for this software to correctly operate. Plug in the Reader, then execute the program.

   If you get the error "scardsyn.dll is missing", there is a copy in the lib/ folder, copy this dll
   to the same location as the compiled executable.

2. Why did you remove the MASTER KEYS?
   HID Global are rather protective over their MASTER KEYS, they dont want them publically published.

3. Where can I get the MASTER KEYS? 
   Unfortunately, your going to have to either hack a RW300 Rev A Reader, or Sign HID Globals' NDA.

4. Can you Give me the MASTER KEYS, or can I buy them from you?
   Simple answer: NO.

5. I have the MASTER KEYS where do I put them in the code?
   Theres a place holder for the keys in uMain.cpp, simply replace the null placeholder with the MASTER KEYS
   and recompile.

6. How can I write to iClass Cards?
   This software only reads the cards, and dissects fields to help you get a better understanding of the 
   formatting and structure.  Currently the software has no write operations.
